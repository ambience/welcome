> The Ambients Protocol community repo

The Ambients Protocol is a new protocol for peer-to-peer programs and data.

This GitHub organization is a place to bring together all of the Ambients repositories, and to work together on making Ambients better. This repo is a launch point for meta-conversations about the community.

Watch this repository to keep abreast of developments in the community, such as spaces for talking to others (for now, use the OrbitDB Gitter, in the badge above), announcements, and so on.
